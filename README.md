Thanks for taking the time to do our java coding challenge.

The objective of this challenge is to evaluate your domain knowledge in software development: code organization, style and best practices.

# Overview:
The main challenge is to provide a solution for both of these problems. There are no business rules & guidelines other than to show us what youâ€™re truly made of. It can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.

### Prerequisites
There are none :) Our main solutions stack include but not limited to Kotlin, Java, AngularJS, Flutter, Spring...  
Feel free to use any languages and technologies you are comfortable with.

_We'll be happy if you cover application with tests._

### Submission Guidelines
- Please fork the repo and then submit a Pull Request when you are done.
- Instructions must be provided to run the application, install any dependencies, and any other information needed.
- Please use version control and make sure we can see the history of how you went about it, rather than just uploading the complete project to GitHub.
